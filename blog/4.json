		"I recently had the pleasure of reading The King’s Son, the debut novel of Darren Harris, a historical fiction set at the end of the War of the Roses. Historical fiction is not a genre I read a lot of, but I’m glad I made time for this one. The story follows a supposed fourth child of Richard III from humble beginnings through an epic journey.",
		"As somebody who has some interest in history, I considered myself well-versed in the War of the Roses, the reign of Richard III, and his eventual fall in battle with Henry VII. Darren Harris rewarded my interest by recreating the characters from history I was familiar with masterfully on the page. I was quite happy, as well, that the story I was familiar with was really just the launching point for The King’s Son and, historical context out of the way, the story continued to hold my interest. The entire story was well paced and the action scenes were exciting and easy to follow. The protagonist, Richard Plantagenet, was well thought out and developed organically through the tumultuous phases of his journey while the supporting cast also had time to shine.",
		"All-in-all, The King’s Son was a fun read which I recommend. I’d also like to congratulate Darren Harris on his incredibly well-written debut. I’ll be looking for your future works, sir."
