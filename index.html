			<p class="paragraph">I am David Redl, a computer scientist and certified ScrumMaster with ten years of industry experience developing software. Within development, I have experience with all stages of the software life cycle and, in addition to being skilled at multiple programming languages, have proven my ability to learn programming languages on the job and continuously adapt to the ever-changing tech industry. Apart from development, I have experience as a ScrumMaster, a Scrum evangelist, and as a mentor to junior developers.</p>
			<p class="paragraph">I am currently at home with my family in the foothills of Alberta on Treaty 7 land. Outside of my jobs, I keep my skills sharp with side projects like this website and am also attempting to hone my craft as a writer. My family and I also enjoy gaming, whether on a table top, computer, or console. In the past, I spent some time working in laboratory settings in the fields of Immunology and Infectious Disease and Medical Genetics. In the latter, I contributed to two journal article publications.</p>

	<p class="description">During my time working for Phoenix Technology Services, I also worked a lot on a team at their sister company, Stream Services.</p>
	<p class="description">At Stream Services I contributed to the development of an electronic drilling recorder, which was a desktop application developed with MVVM design pattern in C# and .NET, as well as a stand-alone desktop application for remote monitoring of drilling data, and the accompanying services, also programmed in C#. For data storage we used Microsoft SQL and a combination of Entity Framework and Dapper for consuming that data in the different applications.</p>
	<p class="description">At Phoenix Technology Services I worked on a monitoring while drilling application, which was a desktop application developed with C# and WinForms. One project I specifically contributed to was an enhancement to that system to allow for parallel decoding of downhole data. I worked closely with an applied scientist who had developed algorithms for novel ways of processing signals and designed an appropriate user interface for displaying the different streams of processed data, with input from other members of the engineering and field teams. An important part of the user interface was a new type of component which scrolled right-to-left with incoming data to display data quality as colored lines. As there could be any number of these components on screen at a time, it was especially important that it be efficient. Readability was also important as we counted on users being able to determine the best data stream with only a glance at this component.</p>
	<p class="description">In addition to development, at Stream Services I provided back-end support to users which heavily relied on SQL and acted as ScrumMaster for the development team.</p>

	<p class="description">At SMART Technologies, I worked on the website team. I contributed to front-end and back-end development of the website as well as content authoring in the Sitecore Content Management System. We used C# and .NET using the MVC design pattern and I also made use of JavaScript, SASS, and AngularJS. A couple projects I worked on while there include the training website and an authorized sellers portal.</p>
	<p class="description">For the training website, the team had contracted to a 3rd party for much of the development. However, the version sent to us was not developed for the same version of some critical dependencies that we were using and I needed to adjust the supplied code to match the dependency APIs. I also touched up the styling of the interface as designs had changed during the contractor phase.</p>
	<p class="description">For the authorized sellers portal, I was more involved in the front-end than I had been for most of my time at SMART Technologies. For a couple components on the dashboard, our User Experience specialist had designed a donut chart. Although some members of the team were okay with the idea of turning that into a pie chart to make it easier to use a CSS solution, I spent some of my own time to design a proof-of-concept for the donut chart using JavaScript and a canvas tag. The proof-of-concept was accepted and the final product used my donut chart implementation to match the original design.</p>
	<p class="description">In addition to development, I was involved in the interview process for additional team members.</p>

	<p class="description">Within Amazon, I worked as part of a short-lived initiative called Amazon Local which was a daily deals service being tested in a couple small areas. The main project I worked on while there was the system for business clients to create and schedule new deals to be offered to customers through the Amazon Local system.</p>
	<p class="description">For this project, it was necessary for me to learn Ruby-On-Rails to maintain a legacy system that pre-dated my employment while also using Java and Java Server Pages to develop for the then current system. The entire system utilized a micro-service architecture and my development was part of a Continuous Deployment framework.</p>

	<p class="description">The main project I worked on while in this role was a new electronic document management system for the fundraising arm of the University of Calgary, the Development Office. The goal of the project was to replace a very analog and delay-prone system of typing documents, printing them, handing them off for review, and then re-typing changes as needed. Instead, we wanted a system where documents were stored digitally, passed between users for the review, editing, and sign-off processes, and only printed when it came time for signatures.</p>
	<p class="description">My two-developer team gathered requirements, made technical decisions, designed user interfaces with feedback from users, and implemented this new system. We chose to use C# and ASP.NET for development. The parts of this project for which I was most responsible were integration with the university's existing single sign-on system, and a document comparison feature to display edits between versions of a document. For the latter, I was able to adapt an algorithm I had become familiar with during my time studying genetics that was originally designed to compare and locally align DNA sequences.</p>

	<p class="description">While I was a student researcher at the Department of Medical Genetics at the Alberta Children's Hospital and University of Calgary, the department was presented with multiple individuals with an apparent novel genetic disorder. After regions of homozygosity were identified by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array, I was pointed at a candidate region of homozygosity.</p>
	<p class="description">I worked with my supervisor and human genome databases including information about known disorders, functional information, and expression information, of genes in the candidate region to determine a list of priority genes for sequencing. I designed primers using bioinformatics tools to match DNA outside of each exon in the priority genes. After the primers were created elsewhere, I performed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify the DNA of the exons and surrounding intron areas in three patients, a parent, and unaffected control and then sequenced the DNA.</p>
	<p class="description">A potential causative mutation was identified in one of the prioritized genes and further investigation was carried out by the team.</p>

	<p class="description">While I was a student researcher at the Department of Medical Genetics at the Alberta Children's Hospital and University of Calgary, the department was presented with an individual with an apparent novel mutation causing Bardet-Biedl syndrome. After regions of homozygosity were identified by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array, I was pointed at a candidate gene, BBS2.</p>
	<p class="description">I used bioinformatics tools to design primers to match DNA outside of each exon in the candidate gene. After the primers were created elsewhere, I performed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify the DNA of the exons and surrounding intron areas in a patient, parent, and unaffected control and then sequenced the DNA. Upon reviewing the sequence, my supervisor and I identified there was a mutation in an intron/exon boundary that could result in an exon missing from the resulting RNA. I designed primers matching exon DNA and, after they arrived, I generated complementary DNA (cDNA) from extracted RNA and amplified the relevant region using the exonic primers and PCR. I used agarose gel electrophoresis to separate the amplified fragments according to size. I then cut the agarose gel to separate abnormally sized fragments and sequenced them using the same amplification primers.</p>
	<p class="description">It was determined from the sequences that there were exon deletions in the RNA that could be causative mutations.</p>
